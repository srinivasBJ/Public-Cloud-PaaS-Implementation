# ZephyrOS Vehicle Cloud Monitoring System (Public Cloud PaaS)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Platform as a Service (PaaS) in a Public Cloud environment using Railway. The system simulates a vehicle monitoring dashboard built on Zephyr Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) and deployed on a cloud platform.

The application monitors vehicle engine status, driver health, and cloud connectivity through a web dashboard hosted on a public cloud without managing servers or infrastructure.

## Deployment Steps

1. Created web application using HTML and CSS
2. Uploaded project files to GitHub repository
3. Connected GitHub repository to Railway platform
4. Railway automatically deployed the application
5. Generated public domain URL
6. Accessed application through browser
